# Stock_price_prediction_model_with-risk-assesment
In this file I have tried to make multiplr models to perform the causal analysis and prediction of Stock data of US closing price, or just closing prices of tickers available on Yahoo Finance. Initially I have used a programme that engages with the user to take the stocks that he wants to put in his portfolio and allocate weightage which were optimized using Monte-Carlo Simulations. But to perform the risk analysis on twitter there was an issue since I did not have any paid access to Twitter data, I tried scraping it from web, but turns out my web browser is quite new hence web scraping became a bit hard, at the end I had to settle for a limited data that was 4 years old but yet I performed analysis of risk on that only on one stock that was Apple. in future I am planning to use web scraping technique using a different browser getting real time data and do Sentimental Analysis and NLP to derive the risk factors which will be engaging with the user and try to add as many economic insights that we caan derive from the data. Besides this I have developed a multitude of models like the LSTM Model, A fourier model, time series model, Various classification and regression models as well, An LSTM+GRU model as well, I also tried using RL based models but they were quite complex, and also they required some libraries that were posing issues. Using an RL model will also help in development of an RL based automated trader which can be used in BackTrader. I have also made some more research, a list of which I have as below 
<ul>
   <li>A simple LSTM Model</li><li>Twitter based LSTM model</li><li>Twitter based regression and classification</li><li>Prophet based model</li><li>An LSTM+GRU based model</li><li>Fourier and TS Analysis</li><li>MA model</li>
</ul>
